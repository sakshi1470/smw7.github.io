										<h3>Our Mission</h3>
										<p>In the global village era, time has come to look next door which needs our help. We do comment a lot on Facebook, Twitter and many social media platform and convey our message who needs help. But, now time has come of all of us, who wants to personally help, who needs the most.</p>
										<p>Our platform help anyone who needs it. We are not only looking for poor, but also children’s whose childhood is stuck in misery and distress and for them, who believe that their seniors have become liability for them.</p>
										<p>We seek a world of hope, tolerance and social justice, where poverty has been overcome and people live in dignity and security.

											A happy, healthy and creative child whose rights are protected and honored in a society that is built on respect for dignity, justice and equity for all.
											
											We share in community life and respond to the social development needs of society’s most vulnerable children and young people.
											
											We establish facilities and programmes that aim to strengthen families and prevent the abandonment of children.
											
											We join hands with community members to provide education and health care, and respond to emergencies.</p>
										<h3>Our Vision</h3>
										<p>To enable people to take responsibility for the situation of the deprived Indian child and so motivate them to seek resolution through individual and collective action thereby enabling children to realise their full potential.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>To empower underprivileged children, youth and women through relevant education, innovative healthcare and market-focused livelihood programmes.</li>
											<li>To make people discover their potential for action and change.</li>
											<li>To enable peoples’ collectives and movements encompassing diverse segments, to pledge their particular strengths, working in partnership to secure, protect and honour the rights of India’s children.</li>
											<li>We are integrating our programmes and services, and consciously moving from welfare towards development and long term sustainability for seniors. We are working closely with Senior Citizen Associations and encouraging seniors to speak up for their own rights.</li>
											<li>To actively work as a pressure group and focusing on Elder Rights such as the Right to adequate Health Insurance, Right to Universal Pension and working towards providing elders a society with age appropriate services.</li>
									        <li>In our continuing fight against poverty, isolation and neglect of elders though we have made significant strides, but they are just a drop in the ocean.</li>
